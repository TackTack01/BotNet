Most shit is self explanitory works ideally on Ubuntu or a similar distro
tel_brute.py was NOT edited at all by me
tel_brute.py is NOT required for the script to run but is usable as an option when doing scans for port 23(TelNet)
on (what should be) line 24 you can edit the name of the output file and extention
Feel free to mention and issues or changes.
ZMAP IS A REQUIREMENT!!!
